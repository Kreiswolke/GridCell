## GridCell
###### Oliver Eberle

This is a project to investigate the evolving of Grid Cells, found in the entorhinal cortex in mammalian brains. 
The goal is to train a neural network, such that by setting specific learning rules and constraints to the system
the emergence of experimentally observed hexagonal cell arrangement cann be seen after learning.
